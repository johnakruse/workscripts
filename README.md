Introduction
------

This is simply a repository to store some scripts I've used at work, should I 
ever need to revisit them. It also gives a small display of the kind of work 
I've done, though I must warn you if you're reading this that it's not entirely
representative of what I'm capable of. It will give you a brief glimpse at how 
familiar I am with some technologies, though, I hope. If you're a prospective 
employer, thanks for reading this!
